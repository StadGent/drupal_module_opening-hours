## Issues

Issues are intended for reporting bugs and weird behaviour or suggesting
improvements to this project.

Before you submit an issue, please go through the following checklist:

* **FILL IN ALL THE FIELDS ASKED FOR**
* Search through existing issues (*including closed issues!*) first: you might
  be able to get your answer there.
* Double check your issue manually, because it could be an external issue.
* What providers are you using?
* If you post logs, please use pastebin or github gist to store them!
* Give a short step by step of how to reproduce the error.
* What browser are you using and on which OS if it's a front-end issue.
* Which system is this project deployed on if it's an application error.

The more relevant information you provide, the more likely that your issue will
be resolved.
